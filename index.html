              This project is part of <strong>ITEC 4020</strong> at York University and focuses on evaluating 
              ChatGPT’s performance across several academic domains, including History, Social Science, and 
              Computer Security. The goal is to measure how effectively the model answers domain-specific 
              questions and to identify patterns in its accuracy and response behavior.
            </p>

            <p>
              The development process combines front-end design, backend engineering, database integration, and 
              industry IT experience. Together, these components form a complete evaluation pipeline that 
              processes questions from CSV files, stores them in MongoDB, sends them through a Node.js API to 
              ChatGPT, and visualizes the results through interactive charts on this website.

    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This project examines ChatGPT’s performance across three key domains:
      <strong>History</strong>, <strong>Social Science</strong>, and 
      <strong>Computer Security</strong>. Our system integrates Node.js and Express 
      to interact with the ChatGPT API, while MongoDB is used to store all questions 
      and model responses. The front end is built with modern web technologies—including 
      HTML, CSS, JavaScript, WebSockets, and Chart.js—to present our results and 
      visualizations clearly and effectively on this site.
    </p>

    <h3>Research Approach</h3>
    <p>
      Our backend server, built with Node.js and Express, retrieves questions from 
      MongoDB and sends them to the ChatGPT API. It records both the model’s responses 
      and the time taken to generate them, then stores all results back in the database. 
      Using this data, we calculate accuracy within each domain and determine average 
      response times, which are visualized on the Project page through interactive charts.
    </p>

    <h3>Dataset Overview</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>History:</strong> questions focused on major events, historical 
          developments, causes, and outcomes.</li>
      <li><strong>Social Science:</strong> questions related to sociology, psychology, 
          human behaviour, and social systems.</li>
      <li><strong>Computer Security:</strong> questions covering security threats, 
          defensive practices, protocols, and core concepts.</li>
    </ul>
